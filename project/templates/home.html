      Secure, role-based exam booking for CSN students and<br>
      faculty. Fast, simple, and reliable.

    <p class="home-body">
      The Exam Registration System provides a simple and convenient way for CSN
      students to reserve testing appointments online. Instead of visiting a campus
      office or calling to schedule, students can choose their preferred exam
      location, date, and time directly through the system. Once logged in, the
      platform automatically recognizes the user and guides them through a quick
      and streamlined registration process. Designed to be flexible and accessible,
      the system allows students to view available sessions in real time, check exam
      availability, and manage their upcoming appointments; all in one place. Faculty
      are also supported through dedicated role-based features that simplify
      oversight and exam coordination.
