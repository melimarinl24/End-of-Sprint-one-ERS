# Example .env file for the Exam Registration System
# This file is intended as a checked-in example and should NOT contain real secrets.
# Copy this to a file named `.env` in the repository root and fill in real values when
# developing locally. The app calls load_dotenv(), so `.env` will be automatically
# loaded during startup.

# Flask secret key used to sign sessions and flash messages. Use a long, random
# value in production. Keep the real secret out of version control (i.e. in `.env`).
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=change-me-to-a-secure-value

# Optional MySQL configuration. If these are set the app will prefer MySQL over
# the default SQLite fallback used for local development. Uncomment and set
# real credentials if you want to connect to MySQL.
#MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
#MYSQL_USER=mydbuser
#MYSQL_PASSWORD=mydbpassword
#MYSQL_DB=mydatabase

# Notes:
# - Do not commit a populated `.env` with secrets. This example is safe to commit.
# - The repository already includes a SQLite fallback (dev-data.sqlite) for local
#   development when MYSQL_* variables are not provided.
